# Installation

* You need a publically accessible NATS server with a TLS certificate for Bevygap to work.
* Then we make sure Bevygap knows how to connect to your NATS server.
* We configure settings in the Edgegap dashboard, and create the gameserver docker image
* Set up the matchmaker webservice
* Finally, connect with the game client and see the whole thing in action.

Later, we'll look at how to containerize the matchmaking services for production deployments
